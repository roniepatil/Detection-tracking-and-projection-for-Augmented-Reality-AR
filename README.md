# Detect, decode and apply image processing operations on a custom AR Tag

## Author
Rohit M Patil

## Description
This project will focus on detecting a custom AR Tag (a form of fiducial marker), that is used for obtaining a point of reference in the real world, such as in augmented reality applications. There are two aspects to using an AR Tag, namely detection and tracking, both of which will be implemented in this project. The detection stage will involve finding the AR Tag from a given image sequence while the tracking stage will involve keeping the tag in “view” throughout the sequence and performing image processing operations based on the tag’s orientation and position (a.k.a. the pose).
